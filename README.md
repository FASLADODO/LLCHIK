local sparse coding wit histogram intersection kernel(HIK)

This project focuses on image feature building. We hope to build discriminative 
  image features.
It embeds histogram intersection kernel into the method named 'local-constrained linear coding for image classification' (cvpr 2010)
, and encodes the codes on the mapping space.
